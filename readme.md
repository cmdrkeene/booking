# Booking

A playground app that implements an apartment booking application.

The goal is to explore new techniques for building rich applications in [Golang](http://golang.org).

## Setup

    $ go version
    go version go1.4.1 darwin/amd64
    $ go get ./...

## Testing

Use the standard `go test ./...` tool, or even better:

    $ ./autotest.sh

## TODO

* Finish one-step booking form
* Web interface to cancel
* Send email on book and cancel to admin and guest
